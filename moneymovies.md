* I.O.U.S.A. (2008)
Will the United States of America go broke in your lifetime? This documentary examines the
myriad reasons why such a dangerous outcome is a distinct possibility. In the opinion of
some, as the baby boomer generation ages, entitlement programs will be strained to the
breaking point, and an astronomical defense budget and excessive national debt threaten to
hurl the country over the financial brink. If the U.S. is not prepared to change its ways, the
film warns, we'd better be ready for disaster.

Another movie about the debt crisis consuming America, director James D. Scurlock uses satire from Louis C.K. and music from Coldplay to add some flavor to the tough subject of financial doom. Noting similarities between the credit industry and the drug trade, Maxed Out examines the predatory lending practices of some of the biggest financial institutions and ask that age old question — why?

practices of central banks and the dubious financial actors who brought the world to its
knees in the last crisis. It highlights the Government influence on the money creation
process and how it causes inflation. Moreover, this film explains how most money we use
today is created out of thin air by banks when they create debt. Epic in scope, this film
examines the patterns of technological innovation and questions everything you thought you
knew about money. Is Bitcoin an alternative to national currencies backed by debt? Will
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency spark a revolution in how we use money peer to peer? Is it a gift
to criminals? Or is it the next bubble waiting to burst? If you trust in your money just as it is -
this film has news for you.

a bit more attention to developments in the digital arena. That latter group certainly includes
actor-turned-director Alex Winter, who in films like Downloaded and Deep Web has proven

hype but still awed by blockchain’s potential, the film should have legs once it slides from
theaters to streaming, remaining relevant even as this unruly topic develops.
