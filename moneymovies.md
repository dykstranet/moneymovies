* The Sting (1973)
Set in depression era Chicago, The Sting follows two con men who are looking to get revenge on a major crime boss in town. And they know his weakness — gambling on the horses. What follows is an elaborate sting operation to separate the man from his money without him ever knowing he was part of a "long con." The granddaddy of con man movies, The Sting popularized “the wire,” an elaborate swindle that offered insider tips on race results and assured victims they were betting on a horse guaranteed to win. This is fraud on an industrial scale, complete with fake betting shops and gambling dens and a small army of con-men recruited to pose as patrons and staff. Winner of seven Academy Awards.
Starring Paul Newman & Robert Redford
